# dotfiles

**My configuration files for various programs.**

After using a more-or-less broken script for many years I finally decided to use [GNU/Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) instead. A small wrapper script around it helps me now to deploy the files I need.

```
./stow.sh
```

Additionally to this repositories I keep two other around---one for work and one for personal machines---that contain more sensitive information and are therefore not publicly available.
